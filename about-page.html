Ask for feedback on your strengths and areas for improvement, and seek advice on skills or experiences you should develop. Don't hesitate to talk about long-term aspirations, work-life balance, or strategies for navigating your industry. A good mentor relationship is built on open, honest conversation that helps you grow and succeed.

                  The typical frequency for mentor meetings is once a week, as this allows for consistent guidance and progress tracking. However, the meeting schedule can be tailored to suit your needs. Some clients may prefer to meet more than once a week for more intensive support, while others may find that meeting every two weeks works better for their goals. It's important to discuss your preferred frequency with your mentor and adjust the schedule as needed based on your availability and objectives.
